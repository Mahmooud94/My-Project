The .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project.

The entries in this file can also follow a matching pattern.

* is used as a wildcard match
/ is used to ignore pathnames relative to the .gitignore file
# is used to add comments to a .gitignore file



What Kind of Files Should You Ignore?
Log files
Files with API keys/secrets, credentials, or sensitive information
Useless system files like .DS_Store on macOS
Generated files like dist folders
Dependencies which can be downloaded from a package manager
And there might be other reasons (maybe you make little todo.md files)
